This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Overview
This is a website to add playlists to your Spotify library.  In order to add songs, simply use the search bar to search for your favorite song, which will then appear in the results section.  Clicking on the `+` icon will add the songs to the `My Playlist` section of the website.  You can rename this if you would like.  Finally, click `SAVE TO SPOTIFY` to save this playlist with the given name to your Spotify library.

## Spotify API
This website makes use of the Spotify API to display the search results from a song, as well as to add the songs to your own Spotify playlist's account.  In order to achieve this, once performing any of these activities you will be prompted by Spotify to log in to your Spotofy account.  You will only be asked to do this once.  

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
